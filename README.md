# Day of the Week Calculator
A project from 2013.

## How to Run It
Run the "Day Of The Week Calculator" file located in the "Debug" folder. From there, follow the instructions on your screen.

## How it Works
The Day of the Week Calculator works using the Doomsday Algorithm, an algorithm used to calculate the day of the week from any given date. Every year has a certain "doomsday," or a day of the week that falls on memorable dates. For example, these dates all have the same day of the week in any year: 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, and the last day of February. This algorithm accounts for leap years. For more information, see the powerpoint included in this repository.
